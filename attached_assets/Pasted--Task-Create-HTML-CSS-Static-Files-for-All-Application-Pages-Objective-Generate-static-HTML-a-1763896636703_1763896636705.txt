HTML File Requirements:
Semantic HTML5: Use proper semantic tags (header, nav, section, aside, main, footer)
Accessibility: Include ARIA labels, alt text for images, semantic structure
Mobile-First: Start with mobile then scale to desktop
No JavaScript: Pure static HTML files (no functionality, just structure)
Responsive Images: Use placeholder images with proper aspect ratios
Meta Tags: Include viewport, charset, title, description
CSS File Requirements:
Desktop Breakpoint: 1024px+ (or custom)
Mobile Breakpoint: Below 768px
Tailwind-Compatible Classes: Use class names similar to Tailwind (flex, gap, p-4, text-lg, etc.) OR pure CSS with CSS variables
Color Variables: Define in assets/colors.css with Vietnamese naming
Responsive Design: Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layouts
No Framework Dependencies: Pure CSS (no Bootstrap, no Tailwind import)
Dark Mode Support: Include both light and dark theme CSS variables
Page-Specific Content Guidance:
Login Page:
Email/Password input fields
Remember me checkbox
Sign in button
Forgot password link
Logo/branding
Dashboard:
Statistics cards (total employees, departments, pending leaves, today attendance)
Charts/graphs placeholders (attendance trends, leave trends)
Quick actions buttons
Recent activities table
Sidebar navigation
Employee Management Pages:
Table with columns (ID, Name, Department, Position, Status, Actions)
Filter/search bar
Add new button
Action buttons (view, edit, delete)
Pagination (if needed)
Leave Management:
Leave request form (from date, to date, reason, leave type)

Design Consistency:
Header: Navigation bar with user profile
Sidebar: Navigation menu (visible on desktop, hamburger on mobile)
Color Scheme: Use professional HR management colors
Primary: Blue (#3B82F6 or similar)
Success: Green (#10B981)
Warning: Yellow (#F59E0B)
Danger: Red (#EF4444)
Neutral: Gray (#6B7280)
Typography:
Headings: Bold/Semi-bold, 24px-32px
Body text: Regular, 14px-16px
Labels: Semi-bold, 12px-14px
Mobile-Specific Considerations:
Touch targets: Minimum 44px height for buttons
Spacing: Increased padding for mobile (16px-24px)
Stack layouts: Vertical stacking instead of horizontal
Navigation: Hamburger menu instead of full sidebar
Modals: Full-screen or bottom-sheet style
Forms: Single column, full-width inputs
Naming Convention:
Folder: {number}-{page-name} (e.g., 01-login, 02-dashboard)
Files: desktop.html, desktop.css, mobile.html, mobile.css
CSS Classes: kebab-case (e.g., .employee-table, .action-button)
